    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        You can't go wrong with this Greek salad, 
        especially if you remember the only and most important tip: toss it with the vinegar first before adding olive oil. 
        If you don't, it will not taste as good. Which reminds me, giving the amounts here is very difficult, 
        since this really should be made to your tastes, so please use the ingredient list as a very rough outline.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients - What it takes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cucumbers, seeded and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cups crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>cup black olives, pitted and sliced</li>
        <li>cups diced roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>⅓ cup diced oil packed sun-dried tomatoes, drained, oil reserved</li>
        <li>½ red onion, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
